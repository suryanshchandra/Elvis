1. Purchase all parts as listed in the BillOfMaterials.xls.

2. Open Elvis1.0_LaserCut2d.3dm with Rhino 5.0 or above.

3. All parts are tabulated into material thicknesses. The file is in millimetres.

4. Nest the parts to suit the material size/laser cutter bed size available and cut them.

5. Keep the parts grouped as tabulated in the file, to prevent assembly insanity.

6. Open Elvis1.0_Assembly3d.3dm, and start assembling per group. You will need small philips head screwdrivers, tweezers, plastic weld, pliars, electrical insulation tape, etc.

7. Before putting any servos into the assembly, please read through the SettingUpServos.txt included in the hardware folder.

8. Nearly all parts in the Rhino file are named as per their name in the bill of materials. This should help identify the bolts, belts, bearings, etc.
